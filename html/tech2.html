                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
                It is a text file that is interpretted by a browser to render web pages and web applications.

            <header>
                Page Declaration and Head
            </header>
            <p>
                The page declaration lets the browser know what type of document the browser should expect.
                This is immediately followed by the html tag which will encapsulate the rest of the document.
                The document declaration has no closing tag.
                The code below demonstrates the proper use of a declaration tag for html 5 followed by the html tag.
                Inside the html tag resides the rest of the document's information.

            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                &lt;html&gt;

                &lt;/html&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                The head is where the metadata for the document belongs.
                Things you'll find in the head are the title of the page, links, styles, scripts, and other metadata
                needed to run the page.
                The head will not be displayed in the browser.
                It resides between the opening html tag and the opening body tag in the document.
                Here is a sample of some of the things you might find in the head.
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
                    &lt;style&gt;
                    &lt;/style&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="document_header">
            <header>
                Document Header
            </header>
            <p>
                A document header is usually at the top of the page.
                It is where introductory content and/or links are placed.
                You can have more than one per document, but there is usually a main one at the top.

            </p>
            <p>
                The code below demonstrates a basic header that has no links, just a big title.
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;header&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;
                        Hello Everyone!
                    &lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;/header&gt;
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="document_body">
            <header>
                Document Body
            </header>
            <p>
                The body contains the content of the page.
                It has all the pictures, the words, and the hyperlinks of the document.
                Everything that is not the page declaration,the html tag, or the head should reside within the body.
                The body resides within the html tag and below the head tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is an example of the body tag properly placed.
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;html&gt;
                    &lt;head&gt;

                    &lt;/head&gt;
                    &lt;body&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="document_footer">
            <header>
                Document Footer
            </header>
            <p>
                Not every document has a footer, but they can be useful in certain situations.
                Like headers, you can have more than one footer per page and they can contain links.
                The purpose of footers is usually to reference information, tell you about who wrote it or who owns it,
                or just give you a link back to the top so you don't have to scroll.
                Contact information and site maps are usually located here as well.
                A footer will go at the bottom of an element and the information is usually specific to that element.
            </p>
            <p>In this example, the footer is at the bottom of the body tag, so it would probably contain information
                about the entirity of the document.

            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;html&gt;
                    &lt;head&gt;

                    &lt;/head&gt;
                    &lt;body&gt;
                        &lt;header&gt;

                        &lt;/header&gt;
                        &lt;footer&gt;
                            
                        &lt;/footer&gt;
                    &lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;

<!-- 
X User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content
(technical documentation).

X User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section.
There should be a minimum of 5.

X User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that
describes the topic of that section.

X User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the
text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains
the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").

X User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).

X User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

X User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

X User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".

X User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the
technical documentation.

X User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be
one for every element with the class main-section.

X User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

X User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within
each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the
text "Hello world").

X User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc
element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section
element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

X User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left
side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
